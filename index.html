                        <p class="paper-abstract">This chapter reconceptualizes the financial architecture of Global
                            Value Chains (GVCs), arguing that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) provides the structural
                            foundation while Trade and Supply Chain Finance (TF/SCF) ensures operational fluidity. Using
                            a gravity framework, we first show that trade and FDI have distinct financial underpinnings:
                            trade is more sensitive to bilateral stock market development, while FDI responds more to
                            private credit depth. Next, we apply network analysis to distinguish productive investment
                            from "phantom FDI," revealing a resilient "real economy" network where trade and FDI
                            centrality remain highly correlated once tax havens are excluded. Finally, our econometric
                            analysis provides evidence of "GVC assimilation," showing that FDI fosters convergence in
                            the use of capital inputs between source and host countries—a key channel for
                            capital-embodied technology transfer—but not in intermediate inputs. We conclude that deep
                            GVC integration requires a dual policy strategy that supports both long-term investment and
                            the short-term financing that allows local firms to connect and upgrade within these global
                            production networks.</p>

                        <p class="paper-abstract">This paper investigates how Chinese outbound foreign direct investment
                            (FDI) influences the integration of host countries into China’s global supply network,
                            addressing a key question: Does Chinese FDI deepen supply chain linkages between host
                            economies and China? To answer this, I develop a comprehensive empirical–theoretical
                            framework leveraging a novel dataset that uniquely combines detailed Chinese FDI records,
                            firm-to-firm international trade data, and input–output industry linkages. Empirically, I
                            first provide indirect evidence through sector-level analysis demonstrating significant
                            downstream impacts—Chinese investments in downstream sectors are associated with notable
                            increases in the market share of Chinese firms operating in related upstream industries.
                            Additionally, I uncover evidence of upstream effects, showing that Chinese investments in
                            sectors with high upstreamness correlate with increased host-country exports back to China,
                            particularly benefiting lower-income economies.</p>

                        <p class="paper-abstract">We conceptualize compute—proxied by cloud GPU price-per-performance
                            and proximity to cloud regions—as a price-observable, partly tradable factor, and treat
                            latency and data-localization as bilateral iceberg costs for AI inference services. A
                            unified Ricardian–HO framework with a compute–skill nest links exporter compute endowments
                            and route-specific frictions to specialization in digitally deliverable services and, over
                            time, to high-tech merchandise. Empirically, we assemble a quarterly Compute Price Index
                            from posted cloud prices mapped to MLPerf benchmarks, a bilateral latency matrix validated
                            with public active-measurement data and perturbed by submarine-cable shocks, and
                            digital-trade restrictiveness indices. Using PPML gravity with exporter- and importer-time
                            fixed effects, we identify effects via staggered cloud-region openings (access/latency
                            instruments) and energy-price shifters (compute costs). We test whether cheaper/nearer
                            compute boosts digital exports, whether latency and data rules interact multiplicatively,
                            and whether sustained compute improvements raise high-tech export shares. Policy
                            counterfactuals quantify the trade and welfare impacts of sovereign-cloud mandates,
                            infrastructure rollouts, and energy shocks—showing how "compute as capital" and "latency as
                            tariff" jointly determine who captures the gains from AI.</p>

                            granularity. We construct a model that predicts October 2025 trade values between the United
                            States, China, and their top trading partners at the HS4-product level using a combination
                            of machine learning and time-series baselines. The model incorporates over twenty
                            macroeconomic, financial, and commodity indicators as exogenous drivers. Using LightGBM with
                            a Tweedie loss function, the model handles the zero-inflated, heavytailed nature of trade
                            data. Internal cross-validation indicates promising performance, with sMAPE of 43.22% and a
                            total predicted trade volume of $156.4 billion. We discuss the model's construction,
                            performance, and broader implications for forecasting disaggregated trade flows.</p>
