                        <p class="paper-abstract">This paper investigates how Chinese outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) influences the integration of host countries into China’s global supply network, addressing a key question: Does Chinese FDI deepen supply chain linkages between host economies and China? To answer this, I develop a comprehensive empirical–theoretical framework leveraging a novel dataset that uniquely combines detailed Chinese FDI records, firm-to-firm international trade data, and input–output industry linkages. Empirically, I first provide indirect evidence through sector-level analysis demonstrating significant downstream impacts—Chinese investments in downstream sectors are associated with notable increases in the market share of Chinese firms operating in related upstream industries. Additionally, I uncover evidence of upstream effects, showing that Chinese investments in sectors with high upstreamness correlate with increased host-country exports back to China, particularly benefiting lower-income economies.</p>

                        <p class="paper-abstract">We take a network view of foreign direct investment (FDI) and global value chains (GVCs). First, we build a multiplex—linking countries by trade and by FDI—and track its evolution with edge-weighted centrality and coreness measures. Two facts emerge: (i) the FDI network has become more hub-and-spoke with outsized roles for offshore financial centers; (ii) trade and FDI centralities have increasingly decoupled since the early 2000s, implying distinct architectures for goods flows vs. ownership/finance. Second, using a dyadic gravity framework with high-dimensional fixed effects, we show that strengthening an FDI tie is associated with assimilation along supply chains: source–host pairs converge in their capital-expenditure baskets (especially in imported-capital-intensive sectors), while intermediate-input mixes move little; export bundles converge in tandem. The results indicate that FDI propagates capital-embodied know-how and reconfigures production linkages, rather than operating as a purely financial reallocation.</p>

                        <p class="paper-authors">with Yitian Zhang</p>
                        <p class="paper-abstract">We conceptualize compute—proxied by cloud GPU price-per-performance and proximity to cloud regions—as a price-observable, partly tradable factor, and treat latency and data-localization as bilateral iceberg costs for AI inference services. A unified Ricardian–HO framework with a compute–skill nest links exporter compute endowments and route-specific frictions to specialization in digitally deliverable services and, over time, to high-tech merchandise. Empirically, we assemble a quarterly Compute Price Index from posted cloud prices mapped to MLPerf benchmarks, a bilateral latency matrix validated with public active-measurement data and perturbed by submarine-cable shocks, and digital-trade restrictiveness indices. Using PPML gravity with exporter- and importer-time fixed effects, we identify effects via staggered cloud-region openings (access/latency instruments) and energy-price shifters (compute costs). We test whether cheaper/nearer compute boosts digital exports, whether latency and data rules interact multiplicatively, and whether sustained compute improvements raise high-tech export shares. Policy counterfactuals quantify the trade and welfare impacts of sovereign-cloud mandates, infrastructure rollouts, and energy shocks—showing how "compute as capital" and "latency as tariff" jointly determine who captures the gains from AI.</p>

The challenge tasks participants with forecasting monthly trade values at a highly disaggregated product level, providing valuable insights for trade policy and economic analysis.</p>
                        <p class="paper-abstract">This paper introduces a forecasting framework developed for the AI for Trade Challenge, targeting monthly bilateral trade flows at a high level of product granularity. We construct a model that predicts October 2025 trade values between the United States, China, and their top trading partners at the HS4-product level using a combination of machine learning and time-series baselines. The model incorporates over twenty macroeconomic, financial, and commodity indicators as exogenous drivers. Using LightGBM with a Tweedie loss function, the model handles the zero-inflated, heavytailed nature of trade data. Internal cross-validation indicates promising performance, with sMAPE of 43.22% and a total predicted trade volume of $156.4 billion. We discuss the model's construction, performance, and broader implications for forecasting disaggregated trade flows.</p>
